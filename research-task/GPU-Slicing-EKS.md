# Enabling GPU Slicing on EKS Clusters for Cost Optimization

To help optimize GPU costs on Amazon EKS, GPU slicing can be enabled using NVIDIA’s Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) and time-slicing capabilities. Here’s a guide on setting up GPU slicing for efficient GPU utilization across AI workloads and integrating it with Karpenter for autoscaling.

## 1. Configuring GPU Slicing on EKS Clusters

   - **Install NVIDIA GPU Operator**: First, install the NVIDIA GPU Operator on your EKS cluster. This tool simplifies the management and setup of GPU resources across Kubernetes nodes.
   - **Enable Time Slicing**: Once the GPU operator is installed, configure time slicing for GPUs by creating a `ConfigMap` with time-slicing settings. For example, define a configuration that partitions GPU resources, allowing multiple workloads to share a single GPU. 
   
     Example steps to apply this configuration:
     1. Create a `ConfigMap` file (e.g., `time-slicing-config-all.yaml`) with the time-slicing parameters.
     2. Deploy this configuration using `kubectl`.
     3. Patch the cluster policy to apply these settings cluster-wide.

   - **Setting up MIG**: If using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, enable MIG to partition GPUs into smaller instances, each isolated for different workloads. Configure MIG in the GPU operator settings within your cluster policy to divide the GPU into up to seven instances, balancing workload demands.

## 2. Integrating with Karpenter for Cost Efficiency

   Karpenter, an autoscaler for EKS, helps manage node scaling based on workload needs, including GPU demands. To integrate Karpenter with GPU slicing:

   - **Node Provisioning**: Configure Karpenter to provision nodes with the necessary labels to support GPU slicing. Define constraints in Karpenter’s configuration to ensure provisioning of GPU-enabled nodes based on workload demands.
   - **Scaling with GPU Capacity**: Combining GPU slicing and Karpenter improves resource utilization as workloads are bin-packed across GPUs, and Karpenter scales nodes based on GPU demands, minimizing idle GPU resources.

Setting up these configurations enables efficient sharing of GPU resources, maximizing cost savings on GPU-intensive workloads by avoiding unnecessary node scaling. For detailed instructions, consult AWS and NVIDIA documentation.
